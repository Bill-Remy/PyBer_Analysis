# Pyber Analysis of Fares

# Overview and Scope
The purpose of this study was to determine the impact of fare revenue by type of city in existing markets.  Specifically, the study needs to show how revenue changes by type of geographic grouping: Urban, Suburban, Rural.  

# Approach
The analytical approach used was to collect data by city and ride types and then merge it into a single dataframe for analysis.  The specific data collected and used for analysis was:
- City name
- City type or classification(Urban, Suburban, Rural)
- Number of drivers in the city
- Date of fare or ride
- Fare amount
To accomplish the analysis and develop recommendations, the data was summarized to:
- Total Number of Drivers by city type
- Total Fare Revenue by city type
- Average fare or revenue per ride
- Average fare per driver

# Results

The results of the analysis are summarized in the table below.

As we know, our business model and revenue are driven by two factors:
- Population density which drives number of rides or ride frequency
- Geographic location which drives ride distance.

The summary table clearly shows how the volume of rides increases by more than 10x from Rural to Urban areas.  But the average revenue per ride is highest in the Rural geographies primarily becuase of travel distance.  In fact the average fare per ride is 41% higher for Rural cities compared to Urban cities.  Total Fares or Revenue is of course highest in Urban areas driven by volume of rides and availability of drivers.
